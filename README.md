# travelOp
TravelOp is an app that allows users to post their travel pictures, along with the description, location and recommendation 
regarding the place.

## Inspiration
There are no apps that are stricly for travel. I wanted to create an app that is all about traveling. Where users can see 
the places that others are visiting and what is being said about those locations.

Technologies that I will be using are HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, EJS

## Build Strategy
I will be using the MVC architecture to build my app. I will be starting with my database, user authorization and authention, 
MVC and lastly EJS.

## Time Management
I currently focused on MVP, and hope to get the barebones of my app by Friday. And styling will be done over the weekend.
