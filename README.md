# travelOp
TravelOp is an app that allows users to post their travel pictures, along with the description, location and recommendation regarding the place.

## Inspiration
There are no apps that are stricly for travel. I wanted to create an app that is all about traveling. Where users can manage their travel images. 

Technologies used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL.

## User Stories 
As an user, I can register. 
As an user, I can log in into my account.  
As an user, I can post my travel pictures and description about the location.
As an user, I can create, read, update and delete
As an user, I can see live tweets from a travel magazine CondeNast 
Traveler. 

## MVP 
1) Create database
2) Build CRUD functionality 
3) Render EJS views 
4) Use API (cloudinary/Twitter) 
5) Styling/ Responsive 

## Post MVP 
1) Auth 

## Build Strategy
I will be using the MVC architecture to build my app. I will be starting with my database, user authorization and authention, 
MVC and lastly EJS.

## Time Management
I set up my auth, then proceeded to CRUD, Twitter API, and lastly styling.
