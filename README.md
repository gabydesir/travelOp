# travelOp
TravelOp is an app that allows users to post their travel pictures, along with the description, location and recommendation 
regarding the place.

## Inspiration
There are no apps that are stricly for travel. I wanted to create an app that is all about traveling. Where users can see 
the places that others are visiting and what is being said about those locations.

Technologies that I will be using are HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, EJS

## User Stories 
An user can log in into their account and post their vacation pictures and description about the location. The user can categorize their pictures based on location. The user can see live tweets from Twitter on their home page. 

## MVP 
1) Create database
2) Build CRUD functionality 
3) Render EJS views 
4) Use API (cloudinary/Twitter) 
5) Styling/ Responsive 

## Post MVP 
1) Auth 

## Build Strategy
I will be using the MVC architecture to build my app. I will be starting with my database, user authorization and authention, 
MVC and lastly EJS.

## Time Management
I currently focused on MVP, and hope to get the barebones of my app by Friday. And styling will be done over the weekend.
